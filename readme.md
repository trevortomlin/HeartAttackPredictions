# Heart Attack Predictions

This project uses some EDA techniques to first visualize the data and then create models for it. The models tested on this dataset are: Logistic Regression, a Support Vector Machine, a Random Forest classifier, and a Naive Bayes classifier to predict whether or not an individual will have a heart attack. Finally, it uses a Grid Search to optimize one of the models to get higher results.

The dataset can be found at: [Heart Attack Analysis Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset)
